### Download the data:
- Deaths, cases and 2020/2021 population are coming from API and 2022/2023 population are download from U.S. Census, I already preprocess it at excel and store at `pop.xlsl`. File `population_data.csv` contains combined population. You need to either download all the data from `data` folder or download `pop.xlsx` and run `wrangling.R` at `code` folder.

### Report:
- The final report is at `final-project.pdf`. Run the code `final-project.qmd` at `code` folder to generate all the figure and report.
